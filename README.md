# Headlines to Sentiment

This project deploys a sentiment model that classifies news headlines into three categories:  
✅ *Optimistic*  
⚪ *Neutral*  
❌ *Pessimistic*

The sentiment scores will be used to track daily news sentiment, providing valuable signals to clients such as hedge funds and government agencies.

## Usage

To run the sentiment scoring program, use the following command in your terminal:

python score_headlines.py <input_file> <source>

Example:
python score_headlines.py sample_headlines.txt chicagotribune
